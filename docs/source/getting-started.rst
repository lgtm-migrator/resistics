Getting started
===============

The best way to get started with resistics is to install the package and begin
with the examples.

Installation
------------

Resistics can be installed using pip. For most users, it is recommended to
install both resistics and the resistics-readers package which provides support
for several data formats.

.. code-block:: console

    python -m pip install resistics resistics-readers

For those who do not need the data support in resistics-readers, it is
sufficient to install only resistics

.. code-block:: console

    python -m pip install resistics
