Using projects
--------------

Projects in resistics are the best way to deal with multiple recordings and
sites. They enable the following functionality:

- Multiple recordings at the same sampling frequency can be used to calculate transfer functions
- Processing which combines data from different sites and requires alignment of windows
- Calculation of statistics and deeper analysis of recordings
- Use of multiple configurations (useful for experimentation or mixed instrument surveys)

The use of projects is highly recommended when dealing with more than one or two
sites.
