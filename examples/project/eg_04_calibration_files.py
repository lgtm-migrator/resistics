Calibration files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

So far, none of our project examples use calibration files. Let's look at
how calibration files can be used in the processing sequence.

.. warning::

    I need to find an appropriate example where calibration files are required
    and that can be shared online. If anyone can provide some data that can be
    openly shared, please get in touch.
